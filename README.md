# Ontario-Tech-Programming-Workshop-2
All my Programming Workshop (CSCI 1061U) labs

### Lab 1
Program that reads the contents of a file and outputs all the unique words in it, as well as how many times each word occured

### Lab 2
Similar to the first lab, but a class based implementation.

### Lab 3
A program that takes a file that has on each line a sequence of bits that begins with "P0#: " and user sequence of bits and returns each line in the file that contains the user sequence as well as the number of lines that contain the sequence.

### Lab 4
Program that implements a complex number class as well as overloaded operators for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication with complex numbers, as well as testing if two complex numbers equal each other and printing complex numbers on the form of (a,b) where 'a' is the real part of the complex number and 'b' is the imaginary part. 

The program also lets a user inupt two complex numbers in (a,b) form and disp[lays the result of adding, subtracting, and multiplying them as well as showing if the two numbers are equal.
