# Ontario-Tech-Programming-Workshop-2
All my Programming Workshop (CSCI 1061U) labs

### Lab 1
Program that reads the contents of a file and outputs all the unique words in it, as well as how many times each word occured

### Lab 2
Similar to the first lab, but a class based implementation.

### Lab 3
A program that takes a file that has on each line a sequence of bits that begins with "P0#: " and user sequence of bits and returns each line in the file that contains the user sequence as well as the number of lines that contain the sequence.
